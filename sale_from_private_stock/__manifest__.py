Sale from Private Stock
=======================

This module is particularly useful for companies that lend stock to their distributors and when it's too heavy to create a new warehouse for each distributor.

This module allows to define a private stock location on a customer.

On a sale order, there is a new optional field to define the source stock location. On a sale order, if you select a customer that has a private stock location, this private stock location will be set as the source stock location of the sale order (but you can change it).
